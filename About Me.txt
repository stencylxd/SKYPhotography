Hi!  My name is Sandy and I am a portrait photographer.  I’m really good at photographing young kids who are squirmy and impatient with sitting so that their parents can have beautiful memories of them.  I also do families, couples and professional headshots.  I love capturing new memories of fresh, little ones as well as connections & relationships in families.  Those memories will become sooo precious someday. ☺I also love landscape photography and you will find my portfolio of my favorite images on the main page.  When I’m not behind the camera, you can find me cozied up with my kitty, Kiki, reading a book.  Or in my flower garden, digging in the dirt and enjoying the colorful flowers and hummingbirds!  I’m a Christian, a Wife of 43 years to my husband Clieve, a Mom of a beautiful (inside and out) daughter named Kelly, a Grandma of 2 boys (Miles 16 and Leo 12) and a Photographer.  These are the passions of my life.  The loves of my life.  My grandsons are the reason I became a Photographer in the first place.  They’re why I’m so good at taking portraits of young kids – they’ve had my camera in their faces since they were born, LOL!  One of my favorite quotes is:“Life is too short to be anything but happy.  Love deeply, forgive quickly, take chances, give everything with no regrets and forget the past with exception of what you have learned and remember that everything happens for a reason.”  ~ Abhishek ShuklaI look forward to meeting and working with you.  Sandy Young
