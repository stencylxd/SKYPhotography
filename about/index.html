        My name is Sandy, and I am a portrait photographer. I'm<br />
        really good at photographing young kids who are squirmy and<br />
        impatient with sitting so that their parents can have beautiful<br />
        memories of them. I also do families, couples and professional<br />
        headshots. I love capturing new memories of fresh, little ones<br />
        little ones as well as connections & relationships in families.<br />
        Those memories will become sooo precious someday. <b>☺</b> I also<br />
        love landscape photography, and you will find my portfolio of my<br />
        favorite images on the main page. When I’m not behind the camera,<br />
        the camera, you can find me cozied up with my kitties or reading<br />
        a book. Or in my flower garden, digging in the dirt and enjoying<br />
        the colorful flowers and hummingbirds! I’m a Christian, a Wife of<br />
        43 years to my husband Clieve, a Mom of a beautiful (inside and out)<br />
        daughter named Kelly, a Grandma of 2 boys (Miles 16 and Leo 12) and<br />
        a Photographer. These are the passions of my life. The loves of my<br />
        life. My grandsons are the reason I became a Photographer in the<br />
        first place. They’re why I’m so good at taking portraits of young<br />
        kids – they’ve had my camera in their faces since they were born, LOL!<br /><br />

        One of my favorite quotes is:<br />
        “Life is too short to be anything but happy.<br />
        Love deeply, forgive quickly, take chances,<br />
        give everything with no regrets and forget<br />
        the past with exception of what you have learned<br />
        and remember that everything happens for a reason.”<br />

        I look forward to meeting and working with you.<br />
