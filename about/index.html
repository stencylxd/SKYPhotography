            Hi! My name is Sandy and I am a portrait photographer.
            I’m really good at photographing young kids who are squirmy
            and impatient with sitting so that their parents can have 
            beautiful memories of them. I also do families, couples and
            professional headshots. I love capturing new memories of fresh,
            little ones as well as connections & relationships in families. 
            Those memories will become sooo precious someday. <b>☺</b>
            I also love landscape photography, and you will find my portfolio
            of my favorite images on the main page. When I’m not behind
            the camera, you can find me cozied up with my kitties or
            reading a book. Or in my flower garden, digging in the dirt and
            enjoying the colorful flowers and hummingbirds! I’m a Christian, 
            a Wife of 43 years to my husband Clieve, a Mom of a beautiful 
            (inside and out) daughter named Kelly, a Grandma of 2 boys 
            (Miles 16 and Leo 12) and a Photographer.  These are the passions 
            of my life. The loves of my life. My grandsons are the reason I 
            became a Photographer in the first place.  They’re why I’m so good
            at taking portraits of young kids – they’ve had my camera in their 
            faces since they were born, LOL!<br /><br />

            One of my favorite quotes is:
            “Life is too short to be anything but happy.
            Love deeply, forgive quickly, take chances, 
            give everything with no regrets and forget 
            the past with exception of what you have learned 
            and remember that everything happens for a reason.”<br />

            I look forward to meeting and working with you.<br />
