        Hi! My name is Sandy and I am a portrait photographer.
        <br>
        I’m really good at photographing young kids who are squirmy and impatient with sitting so that their parents can have beautiful memories of them.
        <br>
        I also do families, couples and professional headshots.
        <br>
        I love capturing new memories of fresh, little ones as well as connections & relationships in families. 
        <br>
        Those memories will become sooo precious someday. <b>☺</b>
